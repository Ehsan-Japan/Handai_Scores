#This program was my final project for the "An Introduction to Machine learning with Pyhon" course at Osaka University, Japan.
#I got the full mark on this project and I upload it here so that everyone can use my program.
#This program distinguishes smart and diligent students(students with both high study hours and high final score)from the normal(or lazy)students according to their math and physics final score and based on the hours they have prepared for their final exam
#To make it short,The student with both high number of study hours and high score is distinguished from the student who has not studied enough 
#or has not earned any higher scores in one of the subjects of math or physics or both of them
#It is a simple k-means clustering and linear regression artificial intelligence project
