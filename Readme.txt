#This program was my final project for the "An Introduction to Machine learning with Pyhon" course at Osaka University, Japan.
#I got the full mark on this project and I upload it here so that everyone can use my program.
#This program distinguished the smart and diligrnt students from the normal(or lazy)students according to their math and physics final score
#and based on the hours they have prepared for their final exam
#The student with both high number of study hours and high score is distinguished from the student who has not studied enough 
#or has not earned any higher scores in one of the subjects of math or physics
