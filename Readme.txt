Machine Learning Project: Student Performance Classifier
This repository contains the final project for the "An Introduction to Machine Learning with Python" course at Osaka University, Japan.

Overview
The program aims to classify students into two distinct categories:

Smart and diligent students: Those who have both high study hours and high final scores in math or physics.
Normal (or lazy) students: Those who either haven't studied as much or haven't achieved high scores in math, physics, or both.
In essence, a student with high study hours and scores is distinguished from one who doesn't meet either or both criteria.

Methodology
The classification is achieved using:

K-means clustering
Linear regression
Accomplishment
I received full marks for this project. I'm sharing it here for anyone who wishes to utilize or learn from my implementation.
